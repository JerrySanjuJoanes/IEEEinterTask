<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# SearchFeed Web App

## Description:

The SearchFeed Web App is a responsive website built with React.js, designed to filter feeds based on user input, providing search recommendations for enhanced user experience. It utilizes an API provided in the task description to fetch and display feeds. Users can search for specific keywords, filter feeds by category or channel name, and receive real-time search suggestions to refine their search queries.

## Features:

- **Search Bar with Auto-Suggestions:** Users can enter search queries in the search bar, and the app provides real-time suggestions to assist users in refining their search.
- **Filter by Category:** Users can filter feeds based on predefined categories to narrow down their search results.
- **Filter by Channel Name:** Users can filter feeds by entering the channel name to view specific content from a particular channel.
- **Responsive Design:** The web app is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used:

- React.js
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with media queries for responsiveness)
- JavaScript (for dynamic functionality)
- API Integration (to fetch and display feeds)

## API Used:

The web app utilizes the API provided in the task description to fetch and display feeds.

## Installation:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in your code editor.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run start` to start the development server and view the web app in a web browser at http://localhost:3000.
5. only run it in `localhost 3000` it will only work in it
6. it is hosted in `https://iee-einter-task.vercel.app/` but due to the problem of api it cant fetch data
